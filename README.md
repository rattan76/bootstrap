ðŸ§® Tax Calculation Logic (Example)
Income Tax: 10% of Taxable Income

Education Tax: 2% of Income Tax

Surcharge: 10% of Income Tax (only if it exceeds â‚¹100,000)

Total Tax = Income Tax + Education Tax + Surcharge

Note: These are sample values. The logic can be updated based on actual tax rules.
